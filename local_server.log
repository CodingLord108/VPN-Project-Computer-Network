2024-11-10 21:37:50,688 - INFO - Sending response to VPN Server: Of course! Are you using the VPN client provided by our IT department, or are you setting up a manual connection? If it�s the client, try launching it and let me know if you see any error messages.

2024-11-10 21:38:08,884 - INFO - Received message from VPN Server: I�m using the client, yes. When I try to connect, it says 'Authentication Failed.' I double-checked my credentials, so I�m not sure why it�s failing.
2024-11-10 21:39:14,902 - INFO - Sending response to VPN Server: Got it. That error usually happens if there�s a mismatch with your credentials or if the VPN server has issues. Try resetting your password in the company portal first. After resetting, update the password in your VPN client and reconnect.

2024-11-10 21:39:42,836 - INFO - Received message from VPN Server: Okay, I reset my password and updated it in the VPN client. Now it�s connecting, but it�s very slow. Is that normal?
2024-11-10 21:40:46,600 - INFO - Sending response to VPN Server: Sometimes. VPN speed can depend on your internet connection, the VPN server load, or the encryption level. If you�re on Wi-Fi, try moving closer to your router. You can also try switching the VPN server location if that�s an option in the client.

2024-11-10 21:41:07,440 - INFO - Received message from VPN Server: I tried moving closer to the router, but it�s still sluggish. Should I adjust any settings in the client, like the protocol?
2024-11-10 21:41:19,759 - INFO - Sending response to VPN Server: Good idea! Try switching the protocol from TCP to UDP if the client allows it�UDP is usually faster. Just keep in mind UDP may be less stable on some networks. Let me know if the speed improves.
