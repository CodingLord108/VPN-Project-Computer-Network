# VPN Communication System with Double Encryption

This project demonstrates a simple VPN-like setup with communication between a **VPN Client**, a **VPN Server**, and a **Local Server**, featuring a **Caesar Cipher** and **Fernet** encryption for double-layered security. Each message sent through this system is encrypted first with Caesar Cipher and then with Fernet for enhanced security. The project uses SSL to secure communication between the VPN Client and VPN Server.

## Features

- **Double Encryption**: Messages are first encrypted with Caesar Cipher and then with Fernet.
- **End-to-End Communication**: The system comprises a Client, Server, and Local Server to simulate a VPN setup.
- **Secure SSL**: Communication between VPN Client and VPN Server is secured with SSL.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Tkinter** (Usually pre-installed with Python)
- **cryptography** library for Fernet encryption:
  ```bash
  pip install cryptography
  ```

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vpn-double-encryption.git
   cd vpn-double-encryption
   ```

2. Ensure you have all dependencies installed, specifically `cryptography`.

3. Open a terminal in the project directory.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Generate SSL Certificates

To secure communication between the VPN Client and VPN Server, generate SSL certificates. In the project root, run the following commands:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server_key.pem -out server_cert.pem -days 365
```

- When prompted, enter a passphrase and certificate information as needed.
- This will generate two files: `server_key.pem` (private key) and `server_cert.pem` (certificate).

### Step 2: Generate a Fernet Key

For message encryption, generate a unique **Fernet key** that will be shared between all components. You can generate the Fernet key by running the following Python code:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
print(key.decode())  # Copy this key for use in the next step
```

### Step 3: Update Fernet Key in All Files

Copy the generated Fernet key and replace the `FERNET_KEY` placeholder in each of the following files:

- `local_server.py`
- `vpn_server.py`
- `vpn_client.py`

In each of these files, update the code like this:

```python
FERNET_KEY = b'your-generated-fernet-key-here'
cipher_suite = Fernet(FERNET_KEY)
```

Ensure that the same Fernet key is used in all components to maintain the encryption consistency.

## Running the Project

Run each component in a separate terminal window or tab, in the following order:

1. **Local Server**:
   ```bash
   python local_server.py
   ```

2. **VPN Server**:
   ```bash
   python vpn_server.py
   ```

3. **VPN Client**:
   ```bash
   python vpn_client.py
   ```

Each component will open a graphical interface using Tkinter, allowing you to send and receive messages.

---

## Usage

1. **Sending a Message**: In the **VPN Client** window, type a message in the entry box and press Enter. The message will:
   - Be encrypted with Caesar Cipher.
   - Be encrypted with Fernet.
   - Sent securely via SSL to the VPN Server.

2. **Receiving a Message**:
   - The VPN Server will forward the message to the Local Server.
   - The Local Server decrypts the message in reverse order (Fernet decryption followed by Caesar decryption).
   - The response from the Local Server follows the same encryption flow back to the VPN Client.

3. **Exit**: To terminate, type `bye` in the VPN Client, which will signal the end of the conversation and close all connections.

## File Overview

- **local_server.py**: Simulates a local server that listens for messages from the VPN Server, decrypts them, processes them, and sends a response.
- **vpn_server.py**: Acts as an intermediary server (VPN Server) that handles encrypted communication between the VPN Client and Local Server. Uses SSL and double encryption.
- **vpn_client.py**: The client interface that sends encrypted messages to the VPN Server and receives responses.

---

## Encryption Flow

1. **Client Side (VPN Client)**:
   - Message → Caesar Cipher Encryption → Fernet Encryption → SSL Transmission.

2. **Server Side (VPN Server)**:
   - SSL Transmission → Fernet Decryption → Caesar Cipher Decryption → Message Processing (and the reverse for responses).

## Notes

This project is for educational purposes to illustrate a basic encryption process in a simulated VPN environment. The encryption process uses two layers: Caesar Cipher for basic shifting encryption and Fernet for symmetric encryption with a secure key. For production environments, use robust cryptographic libraries and protocols, and avoid creating custom encryption schemes.

---

## Example Encryption (For Demo Purposes)

### Caesar Cipher Example:
In Caesar Cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places. For example:
- **Original message**: `Hello`
- **Shift 3**: `Khoor`

This is just the first layer of encryption before applying the second layer with Fernet.

### Fernet Encryption:
Fernet encryption uses a symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt messages securely. The message is encrypted with a generated Fernet key and can only be decrypted with the same key.

For example:
- **Original message**: `Hello`
- **Encrypted with Fernet**: `gAAAAABlY...`

When the message reaches the destination server (VPN Server), it will be decrypted using the shared Fernet key and the Caesar Cipher will be reversed to retrieve the original message.
